      "fullDescription": "School Management Dashboard offers a centralized and intuitive platform designed to streamline operations for schools of all sizes. Through this platform, admins can manage student data, monitor attendance, organize class schedules, and oversee staff activities with ease.\n\nTeachers are empowered to track student performance, assign grades, and communicate effectively with students and parents, while students can access learning materials, view timetables, and stay updated on academic progress. With a clean interface and role-based access (Admin, Teacher, Student), the system ensures a smooth, secure, and efficient educational experience for all users.\n\nI applied a user-centered design approach to develop a school management dashboard tailored for administrators, teachers, and students. This involved understanding academic workflows and system requirements, then utilizing UX tools such as user flows, wireframes, interactive prototypes, and mockups to transform those requirements into intuitive, role-based user experiences.",
